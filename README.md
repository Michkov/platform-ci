# Welcome to Platform-CI Repository

Hi! Nice to see you here!

## QUESTION/BUG/RFE ?

Please see the [community page](https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/x/P7l8Ag) for information on how to ask questions on the mailing list and IRC.

You can report bugs or make enhancement requests at the [Platform-CI GitHub issue page](https://github.com/RHQE/platform-ci/issues/new) by filling out the issue template that will be presented.

The GitHub issue tracker may not be the best choice for questions - both IRC and the mailing list are very helpful places for those things, as the community page explains best.


## CONTRIBUTING ?

You may already be familiar with [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to collaborate on Github projects. Same idea applies here.

Please check out the [community page](https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/x/P7l8Ag) for information regarding the contribution process details.

Thanks!
